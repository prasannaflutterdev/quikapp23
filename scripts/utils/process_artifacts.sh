# process_artifacts: Processes Codemagic artifact links to generate download URLs
#
# This function reads the CM_ARTIFACT_LINKS environment variable, which contains
# a JSON array of artifact objects. It uses `jq` to parse this JSON and extract
# the public-facing download URL for each artifact.
#
# The URLs are then formatted into a single string, separated by newlines,
# which can be passed to the email notification script.
#
# If CM_ARTIFACT_LINKS is not set or is empty, it logs a warning and returns
# a "Not available" message.
#
# Returns:
#   A string containing all artifact download URLs, separated by newlines.
